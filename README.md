## **Part 1: Essay Questions (30%)**

### **Q1: Edge AI – Reducing Latency and Enhancing Privacy**

**Explanation:**
Edge AI processes data locally (on devices like smartphones, Raspberry Pi, drones) instead of sending it to a cloud server. This reduces:

* **Latency**: No time-consuming round trips to the cloud; decisions are made instantly.
* **Privacy**: Sensitive data doesn’t leave the device, minimizing exposure.

**Real-world Example – Autonomous Drones:**
In search-and-rescue missions, drones equipped with Edge AI analyze images in real-time to detect people. This avoids latency that cloud-based AI would introduce—crucial for time-sensitive rescue operations. Data is processed on the drone, preserving privacy.

### **Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization**

**Comparison:**

* **Classical AI** uses heuristics or approximation for optimization problems like route planning or scheduling.
* **Quantum AI** leverages qubits and superposition to explore multiple solutions simultaneously—ideal for complex optimization.

**Industries Benefiting Most:**

* **Pharmaceuticals** (e.g., protein folding, drug discovery)
* **Logistics** (e.g., real-time delivery optimization)
* **Finance** (e.g., portfolio optimization)
* **Energy** (e.g., grid management)

### **Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare**

**Impact:**
AI enhances diagnostic accuracy, while humans handle empathy, ethics, and complex judgment.

**Radiologists:** AI can detect anomalies in scans faster and with fewer errors. Radiologists become more like “diagnostic auditors” than image readers.

**Nurses:** AI can automate routine monitoring (e.g., vitals), allowing nurses to focus on patient care and emotional support.

## **Part 2: Case Study Critique (10%)**

### **AI-IoT for Traffic Management**

**How it improves sustainability:**

* **Reduces congestion** using real-time traffic flow prediction.
* **Cuts emissions** by optimizing light signals and redirecting traffic.

**Challenges:**

1. **Data Security** – Large data flows from sensors are vulnerable to breaches.
2. **Interoperability** – Integrating diverse legacy systems can be difficult.

## **Part 3: Practical Implementation (50%)**

### **Task 1: Edge AI Prototype**

**Objective:** Classify recyclable items (plastic, paper, metal) using a lightweight CNN.

**Steps:**

1. Train model in Google Colab (e.g., MobileNetV2).
2. Convert to TensorFlow Lite (`TFLiteConverter`).
3. Test locally or simulate Raspberry Pi.


**Edge AI Benefits:**

* Near-instant classification at trash bins.
* No internet needed—great for remote locations.
* Privacy preserved as images aren’t uploaded.

### **Task 2: AI-Driven IoT – Smart Agriculture System**

**Sensors:**

* Soil Moisture
* Air Temperature
* Light Intensity
* Humidity
* pH Sensor

**AI Model:**
Use a regression model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict crop yield based on environmental factors.

**Data Flow Diagram:**

```

**Proposal Summary (1 page):**
SmartAgri uses real-time data from multiple sensors to feed an AI model that forecasts yields and irrigation needs. This ensures sustainable farming and reduces resource waste.

### **Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine (300 words)**

**Biases:**

* **Ethnic Underrepresentation**: If training data lacks diversity, AI might recommend ineffective or harmful treatments for minority groups.
* **Socioeconomic Bias**: AI might favor treatments accessible only to wealthier demographics.

**Fairness Strategies:**

* Include diverse datasets (e.g., data from multiple ethnic groups and regions).
* Audit models for disparity in prediction accuracy.
* Use explainable AI (XAI) to ensure transparency in recommendations.

## **Part 4: Futuristic Proposal (10%)**

### **AI Application for 2030 – Neural Interface Healthcare AI**

**Problem Solved:**
People with speech or motor disabilities face challenges in communication. The proposed AI decodes thoughts into digital commands using neural interfaces.

**Workflow:**

* **Input**: Brainwave data via EEG or BCI sensors.
* **AI Model**: LSTM + Transformer hybrid for real-time signal decoding.
* **Output**: Converts thoughts into text, speech, or app commands.

**Risks:**

* **Privacy invasion** if brain data is hacked.
* **Dependence on tech** and risk of cognitive manipulation.

**Benefits:**

* Empowering the disabled.
* Revolutionizing education, healthcare, and communication.

## **Bonus Task (10%) – Quantum AI**

### **IBM Quantum Simulation Example:**

Create a quantum superposition circuit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

sim = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, sim, shots=1000).result()
counts = result.get_counts()

print(counts)
```

**AI Optimization Use Case:**
Quantum circuits can simulate molecule interactions exponentially faster than classical computers—revolutionizing **drug discovery** or **genetic analysis**.
